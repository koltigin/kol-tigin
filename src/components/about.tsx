              Hey, it&apos;s Kol Tigin!
            </h2>
            <p className="text-xl text-muted-foreground">
              I&apos;m a biologist with a PhD in zoology, based in TÃ¼rkiye, and I have published numerous articles in the academic community. 
              However, in the Blockchain community, I prefer to remain anonymous, using my pseudonym.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl text-muted-foreground">
              My interest in technology began in the 1990s when I acquired my first desktop computer. 
              I have always been curious and analytical, driven by a passion for research. 
              I still remember the joy and satisfaction of creating my first HTML website, followed by a deeply satisfying night&apos;s sleep. 
              Later, I discovered PHP Fusion, where I developed plugins and themes. 
              Professionally, I use Adobe Illustrator for drawings, but I also enjoy using it as a hobby for personal design projects.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl text-muted-foreground">
              Unfortunately, I was introduced to blockchain a bit later due to my postgraduate studies. 
              However, I adapted quickly, learned a lot, and continue to expand my knowledge. 
              I strongly believe in blockchain and its future. I value decentralization, the permaweb, and privacy. 
              Rather than focusing on competition, I find great fulfillment in achieving goals through collaboration. 
              I am committed to the ethical development of the blockchain community, and together with my team, we will contribute in every way we can.
            </p>
